# Cat-Dog Predictor App üê±üê∂

## Overview
Welcome to the Cat-Dog Predictor app! This application is built using Streamlit and allows you to upload an image of a cat or a dog, and it will predict whether the uploaded image contains a cat or a dog using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## Features
- **Upload Images:** Easily upload images of cats or dogs using the intuitive interface.
- **Predictions:** Get instant predictions for each uploaded image, indicating whether it's a cat or a dog.
- **User-Friendly:** The app is designed with a simple and user-friendly layout, making it accessible for users of all levels.

## How it Works
The app uses a deep learning model trained on a dataset of cat and dog images. The model has learned patterns and features that help it distinguish between cats and dogs. When you upload an image, the model analyzes it and provides a prediction based on what it has learned during training.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit:** The app is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web applications with minimal effort.
- **Deep Learning:** The prediction model is powered by a deep learning algorithm trained on a dataset of cat and dog images.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the app using `streamlit run cat_dog_predictor.py`.
4. Open the provided URL in your web browser to access the app.
5. Upload an image and see the model's prediction for cat or dog.
